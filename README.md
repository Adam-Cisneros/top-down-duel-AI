This Is a small duel minigame with gameplay and art all made by me. The art is included as ".png" files. You must put this art into the images folder in order for this to run the art and animations correctly. If it is in another directory, then change the code that deals with these images (in animate ans self.image mainly) to point to your directory in which the images are.
